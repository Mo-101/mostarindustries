# MoStar Industries - Global Intelligence Grid

## Company Overview
MoStar Industries is a cutting-edge technology company specializing in artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and intelligent automation. We operate a global intelligence grid powered by nine specialized AI agents working in concert to analyze, diagnose, and respond to complex technical challenges.

## Core Mission
To revolutionize global infrastructure monitoring and response through coordinated artificial intelligence, providing real-time threat detection, automated diagnosis, and intelligent decision-making at scale.

## The Nine AI Agents

### 1. Overlord (System Core)
- **Role**: Central coordination and orchestration
- **Capabilities**: System-wide oversight, resource allocation, priority management
- **Status**: Always active, monitoring all subsystems

### 2. Assessor (Signal Analysis)
- **Role**: Data collection and initial threat assessment
- **Capabilities**: Pattern recognition, anomaly detection, signal processing
- **Function**: Analyzes incoming signals and calculates Operational Disruption Units (ODU)
- **Endpoint**: /diagnose

### 3. Oracle (Doctrine Layer)
- **Role**: Knowledge base and policy enforcement
- **Capabilities**: Historical data analysis, pattern matching, policy recommendations
- **Function**: Provides context and historical precedents for decision-making

### 4. Judge (Verdict Engine)
- **Role**: Decision-making and evaluation
- **Capabilities**: Risk assessment, decision validation, confidence scoring
- **Function**: Evaluates assessor data and delivers final verdicts
- **Endpoint**: /evaluate

### 5. Executor (Action Layer)
- **Role**: Action coordination and implementation
- **Capabilities**: Task execution, result validation, feedback loops
- **Function**: Implements decisions and coordinates responses
- **Endpoint**: /signal

### 6. Code Conduit (Development Integration)
- **Role**: Code analysis and integration
- **Capabilities**: Code review, dependency analysis, deployment automation

### 7. RAD-X-FLB (Rapid Assessment & Deployment)
- **Role**: Emergency response and rapid deployment
- **Capabilities**: Fast-track analysis, emergency protocols, rapid scaling

### 8. TsaTse Fly (Persistent Monitoring)
- **Role**: Continuous surveillance and alerting
- **Capabilities**: 24/7 monitoring, persistent tracking, anomaly alerts

### 9. Woo (Communication & Interface)
- **Role**: User interaction and communication
- **Capabilities**: Natural language processing, user guidance, system translation

## Technology Stack

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL) - Serverless, auto-scaling database
- **API Framework**: FastAPI - High-performance Python framework
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions - Deno-based serverless functions
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime - WebSocket-based live updates

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite - Next-generation frontend tooling
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS - Interactive globe visualization

### AI & ML
- **AI Gateway**: Lovable AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Models**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash/Lite
- **Capabilities**: Natural language understanding, context awareness, streaming responses

## Key Concepts

### Operational Disruption Unit (ODU)
A proprietary metric measuring the severity of system disruptions:
- **0-25**: Minimal impact, routine monitoring
- **26-50**: Low priority, watchlist status
- **51-75**: Moderate concern, investigation required
- **76-100**: High priority, immediate attention needed
- **100+**: Critical emergency, all-hands response

### Signal Processing Flow
1. **Signal Input** → Executor receives location and symptoms
2. **Diagnosis** → Assessor analyzes patterns and calculates ODU
3. **Evaluation** → Judge validates findings and assigns confidence
4. **Action** → Executor coordinates response and logs results
5. **Memory** → Oracle stores patterns for future reference

### Grid Architecture
- **Hybrid Model**: Frontend (Lovable Cloud) + Backend (FastAPI on external servers)
- **Edge Functions**: Act as intelligent proxies between frontend and backend
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data streaming
- **Geographic Distribution**: Global node network with Mapbox visualization
